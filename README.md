# bandle-tree-tracker
A Vanilla JS + Flask tracker for Legends of Runterra's The Bandle Tree win condition

Instructions:
1. Open app.py.
2. Enter "http://127.0.0.1:5000" in your favorite web browser.
3. Enter a game of Legends of Runterra. The client should be full screen in order to work. You should see the region's icons appear in the web page.
4. Every time you will play a follower, the icons will update!
5. Enjoy!

Known bugs/issues:
1. Landmarks count as followers.
2. The app will work only on full screen because it calculates the distance between the player's hand and board.
